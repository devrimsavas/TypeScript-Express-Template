# RUN THE TEMPLATE
My template is a modified version of the Express generator, converted to use TypeScript. Since I prefer writing projects in TypeScript, I created this Node Express generator template to make it easier for those who want to use the Express generator with TypeScript."

This version clarifies your intention and highlights the benefits of using your TypeScript template. Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!

Since we use nodemon use

```bash

npm run dev

```

from root directory

in another terminal you can also run

```bash

npm tsc --watch



```

# ABOUT TEMPLATE

# TypeScript Express Template

This repository provides a robust template for building Express applications using TypeScript. It is configured with essential tools and workflows to streamline development, making it an ideal starting point for new projects.

## Features

1. **TypeScript Integration**

   - Fully configured for TypeScript, including type definitions for common packages like `express`, `morgan`, and more.

2. **ES Modules Compatibility**

   - Set up to use ES modules with appropriate configuration for `__dirname` and `__filename`.

3. **Automated Build Process**

   - Includes scripts in `package.json` that automate TypeScript compilation, copying static assets (like `views`), and starting the server.

4. **Development Workflow**

   - Integrated with `nodemon` for automatic rebuilding and restarting of the server upon file changes, improving development efficiency.

5. **Standardized Structure**
   - Organized directory structure separating source files (`src/`) from build outputs (`build/`), with a clear path for assets like `views`.

## How to Use

### 1. Create a Copy of the Template

- Copy the entire project directory (excluding `node_modules` and other unnecessary files) to a new location when starting a new project.

### 2. Update Project-Specific Information

- Update the `package.json` with the new projectâ€™s name, version, and other metadata.
- Customize the `views` directory and other assets or configurations specific to the new project.

### 3. Install Dependencies

- Run `npm install` in the new project directory to install all necessary dependencies.

### 4. Start Development

- Use `npm run dev` to start the development server with automatic rebuilding and restarting.

### 5. Further Customization

- Add more scripts, dependencies, or configurations specific to your new project as needed.

## Sharing the Template

### Version Control

- Consider placing this template in a version control system (like GitHub) to easily clone it for future projects.

### Customization for Teams

- If you're working with a team, you can share this template, ensuring each team member has a consistent project setup.

## Conclusion

This template provides a solid foundation for TypeScript-based Express projects. It saves time and ensures a well-configured, consistent environment for each new project. Customize it further as your needs evolve!
